==============================================


History of streaming portals:

All started with Justin.tv in 2007 to allow anyone to broadcast video online. That webiste went really big and created a whole new economy. Its most viewed content was TV, Sports and Gaming. All content was embeddable (people where able to play or insert the video stream on their homepage). So at that time people started to use those embeded content to generate streaming portals. The last big page doing almost same is Reddit.com https://www.reddit.com/

At first we take a look at one of the oldest and high probably most famous and visited Live streaming page that is called Stream2watch https://www.stream2watch.ws/.

When we check its source code and impressive amount of live sports and TV streaming content we see that all content is embedded and they do not run any streams on their own. How do they handle copyright and dmca takedowns. Do they have the same safe harbor like Youtube https://www.youtube.com/, Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/, livestream.com https://www.livestream.com.com/ and other livestream sites have.



At second we take a look at streaming portals like DAZN, that are copyrightholders for competitions like champions League, NBA, Boxing, UFC and NFL. How can they afford the immense costs as well how much they do proably earn.



Sports Streaming is really popular will there be any changes coming soon ?



In the next course we take a deep look in technical things, like how does a stream work. What kind of streaming format are avavilable.

A Couse special will be the live sports streaming market. How can pages provide free NFL streams https://www.stream2watch.ws/upcoming-events/american-football-01/ or NBA streams https://www.stream2watch.ws/upcoming-events/live-basketball/.
